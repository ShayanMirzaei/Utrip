# Utrip
Final project for an Advanced Programming course in University of Tehran.
In its first phase, we aimed to create a backend code for an online hotel reservation service in which clients could view the
available hotels, filter them by varoius criteria, post comments and ratings, reserve different types of rooms, and cancel 
their reservations if needed.

In the second phase of the project, we aimed to use the data provided to recommend better hotel options for users based on their
own personal ratings, thus needing a bit of machine learning. This was done using different criteria for a hotel, and the weight 
that each user would give to said critera.
