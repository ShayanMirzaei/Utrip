# Utrip
Final project for an Advanced Programming course in University of Tehran.
In its first phase, we aimed to create a backend code for an online hotel reservation service in which clients could view the
available hotels, filter them by varoius criteria, post comments and ratings, reserve different types of rooms, and cancel 
their reservations if needed.
